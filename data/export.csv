"Refugees sue the Republic of Cyprus","The European Commission insists that the Republic of Cyprus has an obligation to give access to asylum procedures to people stuck in the buffer zone. In August there are already 70 people there.46 refugees filed a lawsuit against the Republic of Cyprus accusing the government of refusing to accept their application for refugee status. These people have been living in tents in the demilitarized zone for several months.Commenting on the lawsuit Ioannidis said that the Legal Service was looking into the matter in conjunction with the relevant ministries. “The executive cannot interfere in judicial proceedings so the solution will be found in court” he said.The authorities continue to argue that the presence of refugees in the buffer zone does not oblige them to anything since the government does not have full control over this territory. There is also an argument that the Green Line should not permanently become a new route for refugees seeking to enter the country. Ioannidis criticized the fact that refugees were traveling through Turkey which he called a safe state.Meanwhile a spokeswoman for the European Commission said it was closely monitoring the situation and was in contact with the Cypriot authorities and UNHCR in Cyprus. “The opportunity for any person to apply for international protection on the territory of an EU state including at the border or in a transit zone is provided for by EU law. This is an important element of the right to asylum guaranteed by the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights (Article 18) and the Geneva Convention” said a European Commission spokeswoman.The text was prepared based on materials from Cyprus Mail Report from the sceneCitizens of Afghanistan Iran Sudan and Cameroon live in the buffer zone on the territory of the Aglanji municipality.

"There was a dispute between the peacekeepers and the police","The UN peacekeeping force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) has accused the island's authorities of continuing to prevent refugees from applying for international protection status.UNFICYP said another 44 people some of whom arrived by sea were trapped in the buffer zone near the village of Peristerona.It is not known exactly how these people got into the territory of the Republic of Cyprus. If they did arrive by sea this means they were taken from the coast to the buffer zone ineligible to apply.The new group of refugees includes Syrian citizens and Palestinians fleeing the war in Gaza.UNFICYP spokesman Aleem Siddique said: “Overnight [from 31 July to 1 August] 44 refugees were detained. They were denied access to asylum procedures. At least four of them were detained in government-controlled areas and taken by Cypriot police to the buffer zone despite objections raised by UNFICYP and UNHCR.” He added that this situation requires urgent measures as people live in difficult conditions in the buffer zone.UNFICYP protested against placing people in the buffer zone. Because of this according to the Cyprus Mail a dispute arose between the peacekeepers and the police.UNFICYP and UNHCR resources to hold migrants in the buffer zone are already running out. Organizations will soon be unable to continue caring for refugees trapped on the Green Line.Commenting on the current situation Siddique said: “Effective access to asylum procedures and adequate reception conditions for asylum seekers are obligations under international law. We remain committed to working with the government and other stakeholders to find effective solutions to protect those fleeing conflict and persecution.""Meanwhile the far-right party ELAM welcomed the detention of 44 people. “We reiterate that the state has an obligation to prevent illegal migrants from entering government-controlled areas” the party said releasing a video of the arrest.Let us recall that in May the UNHCR stated that there were 30 people in the demilitarized zone who were not given the opportunity by the Cypriot authorities to apply for refugee status.

"The ancient city of Arsinoe: a monument to intrigue","Today in Cyprus there are no settlements called Arsinoe. But in ancient times there were three such cities. Why were they all called that? The story is based on intrigue and incest.Arsinoe was called: a city on the site of modern Polis Chrysochous a city between Palepaphos and Kato Paphos (approximately in the area of ​​​​the current village of Geroskipou) as well as the ancient city of Salamis (north of modern Famagusta).The name was so popular because it was the name of the wife of the king of Egypt Ptolemy II Philadelphus. Or rather his two wives.Ptolemy was married to his distant maternal relative Arsinoe (305-248 BC). Her father was Lysimachus king of Thrace and Macedonia. Arsinoe was officially declared queen of Egypt. Ptolemy had three children with her. However the Cypriot cities are not named after her.Queen Arsinoe's father Lysimachus was married twice. The second wife 45 years younger than him was the elder sister of King Ptolemy who was also named Arsinoe (316-270 BC).Thus one Arsinoe was both the stepmother and sister-in-law of the other Arsinoe the queen of Egypt.In 279 BC. e. Ptolemy's sister Arsinoe arrived in Egypt. Soon after this the king was informed of a conspiracy that his wife Arsinoe allegedly made against him. The king believed this information and exiled his wife to the city of Koptos. Soon after this Ptolemy married his full sister Arsinoe who became Queen Arsinoe II. Cities in Cyprus which was then part of the Kingdom of Egypt were named in her honor.The text was prepared based on Wikipedia materials.Read alsoThe city of Arsinoe modern Polis Chrysochous has a long and glorious history which you can read about here.Read 436",4

"Thyme in Cyprus is not only a seasoning","Thyme is a common seasoning in meat dishes. In Cyprus two species of this plant have long been collected which are found here in large quantities. These are whole leaf thyme and capitate thyme.Thyme allifolia or livanitis is a low and aromatic shrub. It grows on rocky and arid soils mainly in the Troodos mountain range at an altitude of about 1700 meters. Most often found on the slopes of the hills of Stavrovouni Kornos Kakoradzhi Macheras and Akamas. It blooms from March to June producing many small long and graceful flowers that are pink and white at the base.Livanitis has healing properties. Its oil was used in ancient times as an antipyretic for dysentery diarrhea etc. It is also a popular honey plant.In Cyprus capitate thyme is called trumbin. One of the characteristic plants of the Cypriot countryside which grows independently in barren lands. It is a shrub reaching a height of approximately 45 centimeters aromatic and medicinal. The branches are hard and covered with thorns. The leaves are tiny. It blooms from May to September its flowers are a beautiful pink color small in size but abundant in number.Non-culinary useA special oil is obtained from thyme by distillation which is used in pharmaceuticals in the production of soap and perfumes. In former times Cypriots used thyme for various household chores. For example small bushes were used to kindle fireplaces. Due to its aroma thyme smoke was often used to smoke meat especially lucanika sausages. The sausages were hung up and thyme bushes were burned under them.The plant was widely used in silkworm breeding. On their hard branches it was convenient for silkworms to form a cocoon.In Cypriot society there was even a specialty - a thyme seller (“trumbopoulis”). The plant was sold in armfuls which were carried on donkeys.The text was prepared based on materials from “Polygnosi” Read alsoIf you don’t know which plants to choose for planting in summer and autumn our material will help you.Read 732",4
"Antiphonitis - the only octagonal temple","The Church of Christ Antiphonitis in Kalogrea is one of the most important Byzantine churches on the island which ended up in the occupied territories after the events of 1974. It represents the main temple of the monastery which was abolished several centuries ago.Judging by the surviving temple the monastery was founded at the end of the 12th century. Nothing remains of the original buildings except the ruins of buildings to the east and northeast of the temple.The name of the temple – Antiphonitis – means “responsible”. This epithet is usually applied to Christ so the full name of the church is: Church of Christ Antiphonitis (or the Responding One). But you can often come across the opinion that the monastery was consecrated in honor of the Archangel Michael. Therefore there is an alternative version of the name - the Church of Archangel Antiphonitis.Like many other churches of the Middle Byzantine period this temple was built without a narthex (narthex). It was added in the XIV-XV centuries on the western side and combined with the main temple. Its construction was financed by the Lusignan royal family. At the end of the 15th – beginning of the 16th centuries a colonnade was built on the southern side of the temple.The plan of the church is an octagon. There are only four temples in Cyprus with an octagonal base but only Antiphonitis is well preserved. The eight columns on which the dome rests are located at different distances from each other so the plan of the temple is geometrically uneven. As a result the dome also has an uneven shape.The inside of the temple is painted with frescoes that date from the beginning of the 13th to the end of the 15th century. The original frescoes are preserved in the apse the altar on the eastern supports of the dome in the drums above the north-eastern and south-eastern arches on the southern wall.During Turkish rule the monastery changed owners several times. The Metropolis of Kerynia sold it to a private individual in 1828 a resident named Mariun Christodoulou Apeghitu. A certain monk bought the monastery from her who in 1906 sold it to the Kykkos monastery. Only in 1932 the monastery again returned to the ownership of the Kerynia Metropolis. Since 1974 it has been in occupied territory.On the mapThe text was prepared based on materials from “Polygnosi” Read alsoThe church's frescoes and icons were among the artefacts rescued by ""icon hunter"" Tasoula Hadjittofi.

"VK recipes: Ofton-kleftiko","The Cypriot word ""ofton"" means baked meat. The second word in the name – “kleftiko” – comes from the word “kleftis” that is “thief”. Why did this name appear and how to prepare such a dish?In Greece during the Turkish rule the word “kleftes” was used to describe poor residents who did not have the means to pay taxes. Therefore they went to the mountains where they hid from the Turkish commanders. Obviously with such a lifestyle they did not always earn their living by honest labor. Quite the contrary they often engaged in robbery and theft (including livestock) formed gangs and terrorized local residents.Gradually this way of life was greatly romanticized and the ""kleftes"" from simple robbers hiding from the authorities turned into people's fighters against the Turkish conquerors and into noble partisans.The recipe for a traditional Cypriot dish is associated with these people. Here's how to make it at home.You will need:– 2 kg of lamb chopped into large pieces – 1.5 kg of potatoes – salt pepper oregano bay leaf cinnamon stick – water – cognac (optional)Preparation:– Peel the potatoes wash and cut each one in the middle or into four parts. – Mix salt pepper oregano in a bowl. – Wash the meat rub each piece with a mixture of salt pepper and oregano. Place the meat in a deep heat-resistant bowl. – Rub the potatoes with the remaining spice mixture. Place the potato pieces next to the meat. Add bay leaf cinnamon and pour a glass of water. – Cover the dish with foil and bake for three hours at 200 degrees. After two hours of baking you may need to add more water. – Take out the cooked meat and serve with potatoes. – You can make purguri with the remaining broth from the meat. – Some housewives sprinkled the meat with cognac before baking to remove the unpleasant smell.The text was prepared based on materials from “Chryses Syndages” Other recipesGreek-Cypriot cuisine has a special passion for goat meat.

"How to take care of animals in the heat","The veterinary service is reminding pet owners how to care for their four-legged friends in extreme heat. Livestock owners can apply the same recommendations.The agency urges owners to provide their animals with sufficient shade throughout the day. If there is no natural shade in the room where animals are kept it is necessary to create it artificially. This is especially important to do during hours when temperatures reach their highest levels.In the room where animals live it is necessary to ensure good air circulation using fans or even air conditioners if possible to maintain coolness.Animals must be given fresh and cool water regularly. It is necessary to constantly check the drinking bowl change the water often and monitor its temperature. To keep the water cool longer you can add ice to it.The Veterinary Service also recommends the use of cold compresses for animals. They can be made from improvised means by simply moistening a towel in cool (not cold) water and placing it on the animal.Walking pets and in general all physical activity is best limited to morning and evening hours. It is not recommended to let them outside during the day. If it is impossible to keep the animal at home during the hottest hours then it is better to give preference to frequent and short walks avoiding intense games and running.When going for a walk with your animal think about where exactly you will be walking it. It is better to choose routes that provide sufficient shade. Land without vegetation gets very hot in the sun and can burn your paws. When going for a walk you should take a bottle of water and a bowl for it to give your pet something to drink.Never leave animals in a switched off vehicle. If you need to transport them be sure to turn on the air conditioning in the cabin.It is recommended to regularly check animals for signs of heat stroke. Symptoms include: excessive shortness of breath difficulty breathing rapid heartbeat increased salivation vomiting diarrhea weakness loss of consciousness or contact with the environment. If these symptoms occur animals should be moved to a shady cool place sprinkled with cool (not cold) water allowed to drink a small amount of water and then immediately contact a veterinarian.Some categories of animals are most vulnerable to heat and require special care. These are long-haired animals and animals with thick fur dogs of brachycephalic breeds rabbits guinea pigs hamsters and other small mammals birds such as parrots and canaries horses animals at a young or conversely old age with excess weight or disease .The Veterinary Service also reminds that the law prohibits keeping or temporarily locking cats and dogs on balconies terraces or loggias as well as keeping them on a leash at all times.The text was prepared based on materials from Politis. More recommendationsGo to our article with tips.

"91.5% of junior schoolchildren speak Greek poorly","We are talking about students for whom Greek is not their native language. These results were reached by experts from the Center for Educational Research and Evaluation at the Pedagogical Institute which operates under the auspices of the Ministry of Education.The key objective of the study was to test the level of Greek language proficiency among non-native speakers of Greek. As a rule these are students with a migration background.In the 2023-2024 school year the vast majority of students 91.5% had proficiency levels below the required intermediate level. They were sent to courses to study Greek.Only 8.5% of students for whom Greek is not their native language had the required minimum level of proficiency. The study surveyed a total of 3525 students from government primary schools.The researchers also examined the performance of the Greek course based on the responses of 2070 students who took extra classes. 46% had mastered the required intermediate level 18% were at the entry level and 35% had acquired basic skills.“Based on the results 91.5% of children will be required to attend classes to study Greek as a foreign language during the 2024-2025 school year. Therefore the necessary measures are being taken to staff schools with appropriate teaching staff” the Ministry of Education said in a statement.The study also took educational and sociodemographic variables into account to determine how they contribute to successful Greek acquisition. Three indicators had a positive effect on success in language acquisition:– being born in Cyprus; – having at least one parent/guardian in the family who speaks Greek; – attending primary school from at least fourth grade.The text was prepared based on materials from Cyprus Mail. Read alsoAccording to the Nicosia School Commission 49.5% of public school students are children with a migration background.

"A register of rental real estate will be introduced into the TRNC","The quasi-state “authorities” will require all homeowners who rent out houses or apartments for short-term rentals on travel platforms to register their properties in the new registry. This will help better track the number of tourists visiting the country said the “Minister of Tourism” of the unrecognized state Fikri Ataoglu. In the current situation in the tourist real estate market taking into account vacationers who rent housing for a short period of time is extremely important. The absence of such information leads to distortions in statistics.“We usually talk about two million tourists a year. This is the number of passengers arriving in the country by air and sea. The number of registered beds is around 30000 and we determine the number of tourists based on these two figures” the official said. However there is a nuance. ""TRNC"" does not take into account tourists arriving at airports under the control of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus and then traveling to the occupied territories via the Green Line.“There is an assumption that the real number of tourist arrivals is seven million” Ataoglu said.The Turkish Cypriot Building Contractors Association has informed the ""Ministry of Tourism"" that there are currently around 50000 properties listed on short-term rental platforms. This means that the actual number of beds for tourists exceeds 80000.For this reason the department is preparing to introduce a law to “parliament” that would require owners of short-term rental properties to notify “authorities” about their properties.The “authorities” plan to tax everyone who has registered their property in the registry. “When this law is passed treasury revenue will also increase because they will pay taxes. And since property owners will also be under the control of the “Ministry of Tourism” they will be able to rent out their houses on more comfortable terms” Ataoglu assured.He also made a statement that a new airline will begin flying to Ercan Airport in the near future. According to him such a step will help reduce air ticket prices and attract even more tourists.Currently five airlines fly to Ercan: Turkish Airlines its subsidiary Ajet Pegasus SunExpress and the occupied territories-based Kibris Hava Yollari.The text was prepared based on materials from Cyprus Mail.Read alsoIn March officials from the Sub-Ministry of Tourism inspected short-term rental sites in government-controlled areas.

"There is a shortage of methotrexate in pharmacies","In Cyprus there has been a serious shortage of the drug methotrexate in recent days. It is used in the treatment of a number of diseases. A large batch of this medicine was damaged in a flood at the Ministry of Health warehouse and the department was unable to make up for the losses.The shortage of methotrexate mainly in the 20 mg injectable form has caused concern in various categories of patients. We are talking about people suffering from cancer autoimmune diseases and various types of rheumatic pathologies. Relatives of the patients contacted Politis and reported that methotrexate had disappeared from pharmacies. In one case the patient remained without medication for two weeks. The state pharmacy recommended that he use a higher dosage (25 mg) which was contrary to the doctor’s instructions.The health insurance organization has admitted that in recent days there is indeed a shortage of this drug. A senior employee of the organization Gnosia Anchiotu explained that the consignment of medicine was damaged during a flood at the Ministry of Health warehouse.The health insurance organization asked the manufacturer to send an additional batch but the request remained unanswered. The organization was then able to locate some methotrexate in Greece. This shipment should be delivered to the island soon.An official from the Health Insurance Organization noted that the drug itself is “problematic.” It is difficult to buy and deliver to Cyprus. “This product is no longer of commercial interest so it is difficult to find a supplier. Now it is sold at very low prices which is why many companies do not want to supply it because it will not bring them much profit” Akhniotou said.Methotrexate is a widely used medicine for the treatment of a number of diseases. It is known as an immunomodulatory antirheumatic drug that reduces inflammation in the joints and reduces the activity of the immune system. Patients usually take it in tablet or liquid form but it can often be given as a subcutaneous injection. Injections may be the most appropriate form of methotrexate administration for juvenile idiopathic arthritis.The text was prepared based on materials from Politis. On topicWe talked about the flood at the Ministry of Health warehouse which destroyed almost a million euros worth of medicines here. Read 529",4

"Will English-language programs at universities be paid?","The Ministry of Education and Parliament are discussing whether it is possible to introduce courses in English at public universities and in what format. They first started talking about this eight years ago and now the discussion has reached a new level.A new round of discussions began after the Cypriot authorities gave the green light to the opening of branches of Greek universities.The Ministry of Education has prepared a bill that will pave the way for the opening of bachelor's programs at the University of Cyprus taught in English.

"The British Cemetery in Paphos is overcrowded","Residents of Peyia are expressing concern about the state of the municipality's ""foreign"" cemetery.“My late wife is buried at the far end of the cemetery she passed away in 2012” said one local resident originally from the UK who now lives in a nearby village. “We decided to bury my wife in this place because my relatives lived in Cyprus for many years and always wanted to be buried in Peyia.”Access to his wife's grave has recently become extremely difficult since there is a catastrophic lack of space in the cemetery and new graves are even placed on footpaths.The 64-year-old Briton who has lived on the island for 20 years also expressed disappointment that essential maintenance of the site which should be covered by council taxes was not being carried out.“I had to clear vegetation from my wife’s grave. Many graves are overgrown""“They are happy to sell villas to British pensioners but no one cares how they are buried in the end” said one outraged local resident.Speaking on the issue a senior official from Peyia council acknowledged the problem and said that the municipality was in fact in the process of obtaining the necessary permits to expand the cemetery. For this purpose a nearby plot of land has already been purchased for 500000 euros.“We hope to be able to propose a new cemetery site within a few months but the timing will also depend on the problems caused by local government restructuring” he said.“Peyia is the only community that has separate cemeteries for non-Orthodox and Orthodox burials.”This was not due to any prejudice but because in the late 1990s the municipality saw fit to specifically set aside land for the needs of the rapidly growing expat community. Purely by coincidence the Greek and “British” cemeteries ended up on opposite sides of the road.Visitors to the British cemetery note that the graveyard paths are generally narrower and the graves simpler and smaller often not even having headstones. Officials attributed the difference to cultural factors.“The municipality is responsible for maintaining the paths and collecting waste. The difference in burial style is due to cultural differences and some of those buried in the British cemetery no longer have living relatives who can regularly travel to Cyprus to look after the grave.”The cost of a burial site in the area ranges from 350 to 5000 euros. Cost is determined on a scale that takes into account how long a person has lived in the community and whether they pay property taxes or rent. In Peyia burial site fees are not included in annual taxes.Watt who is director of the Cyprus Crematorium Project said that currently a cremation from Cyprus could be arranged in Vienna or the UK for around €5000 excluding funeral fees while at a local crematorium this could be reduced to around €900 . As for the project's future Watt said operating permits have already been secured and an announcement on its progress may be forthcoming next month.Source: cyprus-mail.com",4

"East Paphos wants to change its name","The newly formed municipality of East Paphos intends to change its name. The new name is intended to better reflect his identity. The authorities of the administrative entity want to be called the Municipality of Ierokipia.Hierokipia is the ancient name of Geroskipu which is found in ancient sources. Translated into Russian it means “sacred gardens” and indicates the existence in these parts of the sacred grove of the goddess Aphrodite.“We want to preserve the historical identity of our area especially Geroskipou” said the mayor of East Paphos Nikos Palios. The decision to change the name was made almost unanimously by the municipal council: 15 people spoke in favor and one against.Hierokopia is mentioned in the work of the ancient Roman scientist Strabo who lived in Asia Minor during the transition from the Roman Republic to the Roman Empire. In Russian translations the name is conveyed according to the classical transcription: Hierokepia or Hierokepida. “Not far from the sea is Hierokepida. Next comes Paphos founded by Agapenor with a harbor and beautifully built sanctuaries” writes Strabo (“Geography” XIV 683 trans. G. A. Stratanovsky).     Nikos Palios served as head of the municipal department for culture under the previous mayor. He is known for advocating that work on a new five-star hotel in Geroskipou should be stopped because important archaeological finds had been made at the site.The authorities of Geroskipou have previously sought to emphasize the rich history of the village and its connection with the goddess of love.The text was prepared based on materials from Cyprus Mail. On topic Residents visitors and businessmen of Paphos are not very familiar with the myth of Aphrodite.

"Amazing old laws still apply","What do deliberate smashing of plates in restaurants duels and fortune telling have in common? It’s very simple: all these actions are prohibited under Cypriot law and are still mentioned in the laws of the country. Fishing and trade “Any person having in his possession on his premises under his control or otherwise in possession of sponges and knowing that it is contrary to law shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £20 and the sponge shall be forfeited.” This is Chapter 146 of the Sponge Fisheries Law of the so-called Chapters which remains part of Cypriot law despite the fact that many of its provisions are already outdated. Cyprus inherited these laws from the British after gaining independence.Some of Britain's outdated laws have been repealed or changed. But the same Law on sponge fishing remains in force although these underwater inhabitants are no longer harvested in Cyprus. They may make you smile but they do not inherently cause any harm. Who could object for example to a law obliging the buyer of carob fruit to weigh the container for the fruit separately from the carob itself if the seller so requests? (Chapter 37 Carob Container Law).Quarantine However the opposite also happens. The law seems to be becoming outdated but then suddenly it becomes relevant again. And then it can start to create problems. This is exactly what happened in 2020 during the pandemic. Since Cyprus has not seen a pandemic for many decades everyone conveniently forgot about the British quarantine law and did not bring it into line with the requirements of the times. And when the problem became relevant again it turned out that although old the law in force was completely inadequate to the prevailing realities right down to the fact that the amount of fines was indicated in pounds. Parliament had to make changes in a hurry which resulted in legislative chaos and the entire procedure for introducing new legislation was called into question. Various prohibitions Laws reflect society but do not change as quickly as it does. For example in Cyprus the following law still applies: “Any person who gives or is responsible for a Muslim festival and whether paid or free employs a dancer or permits a dancer to dance or sing at such a festival is guilty of a misdemeanor” ( Art. 97 of the Criminal Code). And Article 95(A) prohibits breaking utensils in a public amusement establishment: “Whoever in a public amusement establishment intentionally breaks any article of glassware china or any other fragile material is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be liable to imprisonment for six months.” months."" This article is interesting because it was added to the legislation after independence.In fact quite a lot is illegal in Cyprus which no one even suspects. Article 90 prohibits challenging or provoking another person to a duel. Article 304 prohibits residents from telling fortunes or “pretending that they are engaged in any kind of witchcraft divination or casting spells.” It is not entirely clear what will happen to the suspect under this article if he can prove that he was engaged in fortune telling for real and not pretending.Article 178 deals with the case where a man “deliberately and by deception causes any woman not legally married to him to believe that she is legally married to him and based on this belief to cohabit with him or enter into a relationship with him.” sexual intercourse."" From the wording of the article one might assume that women can get away with this behavior.Article 99(B) added in 2018 prohibits anyone from “by word gesture or any other means” preventing a woman from breastfeeding her child.Chapter 196 of the Coinage Law prohibits “melting breaking or otherwise using except as currency any coin currently in circulation in the colony (that is in Cyprus. - Note “VK”) or in any other country.""The knife law seems particularly strict. Article 82 of the Criminal Code provides for a penalty of one year in prison for carrying a knife outside the home even if it does not have a pointed end. However Article 84 makes an exception for certain folding knives. In practice In practice such laws are rarely enforced even if compliance is theoretically possible. “The Legal Service employs smart people. They are not going to bring charges against everyone” lawyer Kriton Dionisiou confidently states.It's much more dangerous when new acts make something you didn't even know illegal or when they are worded too broadly. Dionysiou points for example to Article 7(3) of the Law on Harassment and Stalking (Law No. 114(I)/2021) which applies a common sense test. A person must understand that his behavior amounts to harassment or stalking from a common sense point of view. Is this fair? Can someone be convicted of harassment even if they never actually intended to harass anyone? It can be assumed that some of the current laws will seem as strange 60 years from now as the old ones seem today. The text was prepared based on materials from Cyprus Mail. Read also Thanks to researchers and travelers who left vivid memories of their visit to the island of Aphrodite evidence of the peculiarities of life in Cyprus in different eras has reached us.

"Has waste sorting become a scam?","In 2025 55% of all household waste should be sent for sorting. The European Union has set this goal for the participating countries. Will Cyprus be able to meet the deadline? There are conflicting information coming from different departments.Green Party MP Charalambos Theopemptou posted a photo of a waste sorting plant on his X network account with the caption “Recycling scandal - they throw everything in the Koshi landfill and save thousands of euros.”Theopemptou explained that from January 1 all of Cyprus is required to sort recyclable waste and organic waste must be collected separately. “By 2025 we must achieve 55% of waste sent for recycling. But for now we continue our scam” wrote Theopemptou.The Phileleftheros publication reported in its material that sorted recyclables collected from households end up in a landfill in Koshi and not at a waste processing plant. As a result the level of recycling of recyclable materials from Nicosia Larnaca and Famagusta does not exceed 15%.In response the Department of Environmental Protection issued a statement saying that the sorting rate was reaching 60% not 15%. According to the department the company Green Dot which is responsible for sorting waste approached them with a request to use the landfill in Koshi. This happened after a fire destroyed the Ecobalance plant in Geri in July 2023. Green Dot collects 75000 tonnes of recyclables a year but less than 10000 tonnes of packaging is sent to Koshi for recycling. The only other licensed PMD processing unit remains Barracuda in Limassol which is only able to service Limassol and Paphos. However Phileleftheros clarified in response to this statement that waste arriving at Koshi is indeed first sorted.

"Larnaca's infrastructure is undergoing changes","Larnaca's sustainable urban mobility plan will cost the Larnaca budget €18 million. Its implementation will begin in January 2025 and will last 18 months.The sustainable urban mobility plan involves popularizing public transport and developing alternative modes of transportation improving road safety and improving accessibility for people with disabilities.To do this it will be necessary to improve the main city highways. 15 avenues and streets of Larnaca will change their appearance: – some will become one-way – the number of traffic lanes will be reduced on the main avenues – the main junctions will be improved to increase the level of safety – green spaces will appear on the streets they will be tiled.On the streets selected for the project there will be dedicated bus lines with a total length of approximately 11 km and bicycle paths with a total length of approximately 25 km.

"Who are the streets of Cyprus dedicated to?","In 1960 the government of the newly created Republic of Cyprus sent out a circular to municipalities with a list of names. These were EOKA fighters who died fighting British rule in Cyprus. However two very important names were missing from the list.The names from the circular had to be used when renaming or naming streets in populated areas. Ironically the two names that most often become toponyms in Cyprus were not on this list. Since both historical figures were still alive.We are talking about President Archbishop Makarios and General Georgios Grivas Digenis. Today it is these two names that are most often found on the map of the island; the main avenues and streets of all settlements are named in their honor.Toponymy researcher tellsWith their circular the authorities sent a clear signal about the formation of a Cypriot identity around the struggle for freedom from the colonialists. The topic of Cypriot toponymy is being studied by 52-year-old researcher Stella Feoharous. According to her Cyprus is a country with a complex past so you won’t find place names like Rose Alley or Baker Street here. In 2018 Stella Theocharous began researching street names in Cyprus focusing on Nicosia.“All important events take place in the capital. This is where rulers make decisions and engage in politics” she explains. “The changing names of the streets of Nicosia its ability to expand only in three directions (due to the occupation of the northern half of the city. - VK note) the many dead ends - all this reflects the unique situation of the capital” says the scientist.During her research Stella spent weeks in dusty basements and windowless archives. Under the guidance of the renowned Israeli professor of cultural geography Maoz Azaryahu she visited the British National Archives and the National Library of Scotland in Edinburgh and read countless books written by ancient travelers about Cyprus.In the archives of the Nicosia municipality she found records of the early days of this local government in 1882 when the British appointed Christodoulos Severis as the city's first mayor. In the archives of the Cadastral Department Stella discovered cadastral plans from 1915 which were believed to be lost.In search of patterns in our street names she combed through thousands of long-forgotten documents: files maps photographs newspaper clippings official decrees and minutes of meetings held more than a hundred years ago. During the British era new street names had to be approved by the High Commissioner but the responsibility for naming or renaming streets always lay with the municipal councils of each city.“I set myself a difficult task” she smiles. – In Limassol a complete register of street names has been maintained since 1911. But nowhere in Nicosia has there been a complete register of street names and renamings for decades.”In 1960 municipal councils were given a list of EOKA members from which they could select names to name streets. “This was a highly political act and the message was clear: we will honor the memory of those who sacrificed themselves for our cause and everyone will be forced to use their names every day. Every time you write an address on an envelope you will be honoring our fallen” explains Stella.Photo cyprus-mail.com
Cross out the British rulersStreets named after prominent British figures or monarchs have been renamed. Edward VII Street became Marcos Drakos Street Winston Churchill Avenue became Kyriakos Macis Street Queen Elizabeth II Street was renamed Michael Karaolis Street and Queen Mary Street became Andreas Dimitriou Street.“Whenever there is a shift in identity our street names change” explains Stella. A striking example is the name of Freedom Square. The square received its name in 1975 as a result of a referendum. Before that it was called the square of Ioannis Metaxas who effectively exercised dictatorial powers in Greece from 1936 until his death in 1941. “The renaming was an act of resistance a new vision. People have spoken clearly: “We don’t want dictators anymore we want freedom” says Stella Feoharous.Ledra streetAnd then there is Ledra Street which bears the imprint of the entire history of Cyprus.Originally the current Ledra Street consisted of three. As the city developed they were eventually combined into one which was colloquially called Makridromas that is “long street.” During the struggle against British rule the British nicknamed it the Dead Mile. Today it is known by its name in honor of the ancient city-kingdom that was located here.Besides today it is a dead end. Without a passport you will not be able to walk the main street of the capital from beginning to end.“It is a symbol of our constant division. From Freedom Square to the streets of Markos Drakos and Kythrea (a village in the occupied territories - VK note) our political economic and cultural context is largely reflected in the names. They talk about our struggle our heroes and our occupied villages. They reflect how we see ourselves. In them we see a living memory of our island’s ongoing struggle for freedom” says the scientist.The text was prepared based on materials from Cyprus MailMore about namesThere are hundreds of small cozy villages in Cyprus whose names sound intricate not only to the Russian ear but even to the Cypriots themselves. Where do these unusual names come from? Read the link.Read 579",4
"We talk about the art center in ancient warehouses","Municipal Art Center ""Papadakis Warehouses"" is an exhibition space in the very center of Limassol.

"About the Cypriot origin of the singer of love oak forests and peace","In 1825 Alexander Pushkin wrote the poem “Andrei Chenier.” It described the fate of the famous French poet who became one of the victims of revolutionary terror in France. Pushkin hardly suspected that his hero Andre Chenier was half Cypriot.Chenier lived only 32 years but thanks to his literary activities he earned the title of the forerunner of romanticism.About the poetBorn in 1762 in the family of the French consul in Constantinople Louis Chenier and Elisavet Santi-Chenier the daughter of a merchant from Larnaca.From a young age Chenier was a passionate admirer of the language and culture of Ancient Greece. While studying in Paris he excelled in translating poetry from the Greek classics. In 1784 he traveled to Rome Naples and Pompeii. Served in the diplomatic corps. A royalist he initially supported the French Revolution but later opposed the excesses of the Jacobin Terror. He exposed the dictatorship of Robespierre from the pages of French newspapers. In 1793 he was arrested on suspicion of connections with the royalists and on July 25 1794 he was executed by guillotine.Chénier was known to his contemporaries only as the author of topical political works. The first collection of his poems appeared in print only in 1819 - 25 years after he himself died on the guillotine. In Russia among Chenier’s admirers and translators were E. Baratynsky A.K. Tolstoy A. Fet but above all Pushkin who transcribed several plays by the “singer of love oak forests and peace.”Pushkin was inspired by the fate of Andre Chenier in whom he saw a persecuted genius and with whom he compared himself.The poem “Andrei Chenier” dedicated to the poet can be read here.About his Cypriot motherAndré Chénier's mother née Elisavet Lomakas was born in Larnaca in 1729 the son of the merchant Antonis Lomakas. Elisavet was called a woman of amazing beauty and education. She was interested in ancient Greek culture and ancient authors. By religion her family belonged to Catholicism and probably descended from noble families of medieval Cyprus.Together with her parents she moved to Constantinople. There she met Louis Chénier whom she married in 1754. All eight of her children were born in Constantinople: four boys and four girls. Of these two more besides Andre were destined to leave a mark on the history of France. Louis-Sauveur Chenier (1761-1823) became a military man and participated in the Napoleonic Wars Marie-Joseph Chenier (1764-1811) later became a famous playwright.In 1765 the Chenier family left Constantinople and settled in Paris. There Elisavet began to actively communicate with writers and cultural figures. She herself wrote historical ethnographic and literary works some of which were published in 1879. In 1781 Elisavet opened a literary salon in the capital's Marais quarter.She died in 1808.The text was prepared based on materials from Polygnosi Internet Archive and Wikipedia Read alsoIn 1917 the influential French perfumer François Coty released a perfume in which he mixed the scents of oakmoss cistus and citrus.

"Virtual tour of the missing railway","The Government Railway Museum in the village of Evrychou opened in 2016. He works in a former railway station building. Today we invite you to take a walk through the exhibition with the help of our photo report.ExpositionThe museum transports visitors to the beginning of the twentieth century and antique furniture helps create the appropriate atmosphere. The two floors of the former station feature exhibits reflecting the history and heritage of the railway in Cyprus. Here you can see original documents photographs posters and drawings models of locomotives rolling stock and stations.Outside the building surrounded by a manicured garden approximately 100 meters of original railway tracks can be seen. A handcart and a freight car are on display in the museum's courtyard. In the carriage you can see what was transported by rail at that time and how the internal space was organized.StoryThe idea to build a railway line in Cyprus was born back in 1878 when Great Britain had just gained control of the island. However the uncertainty of the status of the British possession of Cyprus for a long time prevented these plans from being realized. The project which began in 1903 ended on October 21 1915 with the opening ceremony of the station in the village of Evrychou. The trip with all stops took an average of two hours: the morning train departed from Famagusta at 8:35 and arrived in Nicosia at 10:37. The trip cost 5 pence.Trains ran twice a day and on Sundays an additional train was introduced on which the capital's residents went to the sea. In 1940 the schedule was expanded trains began to run three times a day. The first departed from Famagusta at 6:10 the second at 7:50 the third at 14:15. From Nicosia trains depart at 07:30 13:45 and 14:55.The train made stops at the following stations: Port of Famagusta - Famagusta - English Halt station - Engomi - Stilli - Gaiduras - Prastio - Pyrga - Genagra - Vitsada - Musulita - Maratovunos - Angastina - Monastyrskaya station - Epicho - Trakhoni - Mia Milia - Kaimakli – Nicosia – Agios Dometios – Airport – Kokkinotrimithia – Denia – Avlona – Peristerona – Katokopia – Argaki – Morphou – Nikita – Barazhi – Gazivera – Pendaya – Karkotis – Kalo Chorio – Skouriotissa – Flassou – Evrykhou.The first section of the road from Famagusta to Nicosia was 57 km long and opened in 1905. The second section Nicosia-Morphou was 38 km long and began operating in December 1907. In June 1915 the third section from Morphou to Evrychou 120 km long opened. Another 2.2 km of railway tracks were laid in Famagusta from the port to the station.Due to the lack of traffic flow the Morphou-Evrychou section was practically not used and in 1933 traffic from Kalo Chorio to Evrychou was stopped. Most of the cargo flow fell on the Famagusta - Nicosia route where in 1948 a branch was put into operation connecting the Nicosia airfield with the main railway line.The trains also carried local and international correspondence. The local one was handed over at different stations of the route depending on the place of residence of the recipient the international one was taken to the port of Famagusta where it was picked up by ships of the Egyptian transport company Kedivial Mail.In addition to cargo and passenger transportation the Cypriot railway ran trains on special occasions: for “prestigious service” (now they would say “VIP service”) for British officials; “swimming trains” that took residents of Nicosia to the beaches of Famagusta on Saturdays; “trains to the races” timed to coincide with races at the hippodrome. Finally additional personnel were allowed in during the Orange Festival in Famagusta.MotorizationBy 1951 due to the development of the road network the railway became completely unprofitable. The British administration decided to liquidate the railway connection and on December 31 1951 the last locomotive departed from Nicosia to Famagusta. The property was sold and the dismantling of the tracks continued for more than a year.In total during the existence of the Cyprus railway 7348643 passengers and 3199934 tons of cargo were transported along it.Museum opening hoursApril 16 – September 15 Mon – Sun: 9:30-17:00 September 16 – April 15 Mon – Sun 8:30-16:00 Inquiries: +357 22 933010.On topicMore than 90% of Cypriot residents prefer cars to other modes of transport.

"Private clinics cannot send ambulances due to bureaucracy","The quality of the ambulance service continues to raise serious concerns. The Federation of Cyprus Patients' Associations (FPA) expresses its concern at the complete lack of progress on this topic.The organization presented its proposals for reforming the service to the country's president in March of this year. She proposed three options for how a national ambulance service could operate.All of them assume that the management of ambulance services will move away from the Organization of National Health Services (OKIPI) to a new department. It could be:– a sub-ministry or “independent crisis service” (first option) – an independent body for the coordination of emergency services (second option) – or a separate department under the Ministry of Health (third option).All three options assume a transition period so that OKIPI receives profit from the operation of ambulances within two years. “Unfortunately until today that is until the end of July we have not received an answer. No discussion has taken place and the issue remains without progress” said OSAC spokesman Miltos Miltiadus.OSAC's statement comes a few days after the director of the private clinic Limassol Medical Center Andreas Pantazis called for private ambulances to be included in the GeSI.A letter was sent to the Minister of Health Michalis Damianos. There the director of the clinic said that the current system according to which private hospitals affiliated with GeSI are required to have their own ambulances but cannot use them to serve patients under GeSI is unacceptable.Under the current system a private clinic even if it has ambulances is required to request a car from OKIPI to transport patients.“We consider it unacceptable to have ambulances and not have the right to serve our patients with them. OKIPI fulfills its duties with delays patients have to wait for hours for an ambulance” Pantazis writes in an open letter.The text was prepared based on materials from Cyprus Mail and Politis At the same timeThe work of ambulances is seriously complicated by two factors. The first is the selfish attitude of residents and practical jokes. The second is when an ambulance responds to obviously false calls. More details at the link.Read 362",4

"Sheep and goat plague: what are the risks for Cyprus","The disease known as peste des petits ruminants is killing sheep and goats in Greece and Romania. The Veterinary Service is doing everything possible to prevent its spread in Cyprus.The Veterinary Service is participating in an epidemiological study to determine how the virus entered Eastern Europe. This was announced by the director of the department Christodoulos Pipis.About risks and precautionsThere are no cases of the disease in Cyprus yet. But the island's strong ties to Greece make the spread of the plague potentially possible. According to the law Cypriot farmers are required to report cases of this disease to the Veterinary Service.The EU has imposed restrictions on the supply of animals and animal products from affected areas. In addition the Greek Ministry of Agriculture unilaterally decided to prohibit the transport of animals and animal products outside the country in order to contain the spread of the virus.For its part Cyprus cannot independently take measures to ban the import of meat from affected countries as this is contrary to the principle of an open market.About the diseaseThe plague is not transmitted to people. However the virus is very dangerous for small ruminants which it kills.Sick cattle are euthanized. The remains of infected animals are either burned or buried on site if transport to a crematorium is not possible without the risk of spreading the virus. When carcasses are buried on site they are doused with lime and disinfectants.The disease was first reported in 1942 in Ivory Coast and has since spread to many countries in Africa the Middle East and Asia. It has become an endemic disease in Turkey.The virus is transmitted through close contact between healthy and infected animals. And also through contaminated food water and equipment where it can persist for up to 72 hours depending on humidity levels temperature and the presence of natural light.The most common method of further spread of the disease is the transportation of infected animals. The incubation period of the virus is four to six days but can last up to ten.Clinical symptoms include high fever lasting up to five days fatigue lack of appetite increased mucus from the eyes and nose and mouth ulcers. These are followed a few days later by watery bloody diarrhea cough and shortness of breath. If the animal survives symptoms may persist for up to two weeks. The disease has an almost 100% mortality rate.Farmers are urged to keep their animals confined practice good sanitation dispose of waste drain areas of standing water and keep insect and rodent populations low.Animals should be examined daily and the Veterinary Service should be immediately informed of any suspicion of infection or a decrease in milk production.The text was prepared based on materials from Cyprus Mail and PolitisRead alsoCyprus where antibiotic resistance killed 89 people in 2020 is seeking to reduce the use of drugs in livestock production.

"Two species of milkweed are endemic to Cyprus","Euphorbia is a toxic plant that has been used medicinally since ancient times. The genus of milkweed has about 700 species. 25 of them plus five subspecies grow in Cyprus.These are annual and perennial herbs shrubs (often succulent or cactus-like) and sometimes small trees. All species are characterized by the content of caustic milky juice which is where the name of the genus comes from.Euphorbia veneris is an endemic plant of Cyprus that grows in mountainous areas. Blooms from March to June. Cypriots call it “kaloximeroton” that is “beautiful flower at dawn”.Another endemic is Cyprus milkweed (Euphorbia cypria) which grows in the foothills and blooms from April to June.Finally the exclusively Cypriot subspecies – Euphorbia cassia ssp. Rigoi grows in rocky soils and pine forests and blooms from June to September.Milkweed sap can kill small animals. In former times residents of Cypriot villages used it to poison rodents. Pieces of bread were soaked in milkweed juice and left in places where mice had bred.In humans the juice of the plant causes irritation to the skin and mucous membranes of the eyes.The text was prepared based on materials from “Polygnosi” About Cypriot floraThere are 1738 plant species on the island of which 143 are found only here. In terms of the share of plant uniqueness (8.2%) Cyprus ranks first in Europe.

"Road repairs led to collapse in residential areas","Transport collapse occurred in the Larnaca region due to sewerage repair work. The flow of cars is redirected from the main street to secondary roads.On secondary streets cars get stuck in traffic jams making noise and disturbing local residents.The problem arose due to the closed road Meneu - Pervolia. This is the road to the coast between the Soros salt lake and Faros beach. These regions are one of the most popular holiday destinations among Cypriots second only to Protaras in popularity. In the summer many residents of the capital go to their summer homes so traffic is always heavier here during the season. Repair work made the situation worse.Traffic jams filled the streets of Eleftherias and Filias which together form an L-shaped street on the plan. These are two narrow streets where about 20 families live. Since July 22 Eleftherias has been forced to handle much of this traffic flow as the main road is currently closed. The problem is that along with passenger vehicles trucks use this street.The combination of heavy traffic and residential areas poses potential risks for local residents especially children. Drivers get nervous about traffic jams and often begin to behave inappropriately. Local residents reported that the car could drive through a playground or through a private agricultural field.Therefore residents in some places blocked the sidewalk with old furniture and boards blocking the path for cars. Due to the dust raised by cars the parked cars of the people living here are covered with a layer of dirt. According to Holger Gardner who lives in the area the solar panels have become less efficient also due to the layer of dust.The situation escalated on July 27 when two dozen local residents physically blocked the road. The next day the police intervened and traffic began to be regulated. “We have put up signs that say 'local residents only'” says Kypros Andronikou mayor of Dromolaksi-Meneu.All these drivers are technically breaking the law and can be fined. According to local authorities it was never intended that Eleftherias-Filias would become an alternative route. Until recently the street was generally a dead end but recently local authorities covered the area connecting the street with the neighboring road with gravel and it became possible to drive further along it. This was done to make travel easier for local residents but now they themselves greatly regret this initiative of their mayor’s office.The summer months were chosen for sewer repairs for a reason. No work can be carried out in the Salt Lakes area between January and July as this would disturb the fragile ecosystem of the reservoir.The text was prepared based on materials from Cyprus MailOther newsPrivate trailers and vans were evacuated from the coast near Larnaca Nautical Club.

"What are the most common names in Cyprus?","Maria Georgiou is the most common full name in Cyprus!The latest available census data suggests that Cyprus is populated almost exclusively by Marys - there are around 40000 of them on the island. But there are many other names that are extremely popular among Cypriots.Andreas comes in second with about 37000 in Cyprus. Eleni has about 30000 and Giorgos about 26000.Next come: Andrula (20000) Kostas (18000) Christos (16000) as well as Nicholas and Michalis at approximately 15000 each. Panagiotis rounds out the top ten (just under 14000).Variations of each of them (such as Maria Mariana Marios) are ranked separately. But still if you count the number of people with the 10 most common names in Cyprus you get about a quarter of a million people. This is every fourth resident of the island.This is not surprising given that local names are still firmly ingrained in families. Here names become living legacies: the first-born child is usually named after the paternal grandparent. The second son or daughter may well be named after the maternal grandparents.After that it's all up to you: third sons or daughters are often named after the parents themselves godparents favorite aunts and uncles or family saints.This practice exists not only in Cyprus but also in many Southern European countries: Greece traditionally follows a similar hierarchy as do Italy Spain and Portugal. To a lesser extent Russia Poland Iceland and Scotland do this - although here as in Arab countries the father's name can be included both as a patronymic and as a middle name.Interestingly in other parts of the world the system is radically different. In China names are usually chosen for their significant symbols and auspicious sounds that reflect positive qualities and aspirations. In India names are shaped by various traditions religious texts and cultural meanings. In the West the general trend is moving from a small set of very popular names to a wider range of unique nicknames.But not in Cyprus where the 20 most common names together cover almost 30 percent of the population! As for surnames Charalambous and Ioannou lead the way followed by Constantinou and Christodoulou.“All three of my closest friends are named Marios. Off the top of my head I can think of at least seven Marias and four Andreases that I have known since childhood! Three of them are a colleague the second is a kumbaros the third is a mechanic” says Sotiris Charalambous. Sotiris brings up a good point. With so many common names Cyprus puts an end to the theory that a name determines destiny: the idea that people with the same name have similar personalities. But that doesn't stop others from making assumptions.Recent research (published in Psychology Today) shows that we perceive some names in the same way jumping to conclusions without even meeting the person in question. Elizabeth is perceived as warm and competent Riley as warm but incompetent and Ruth as cold but capable.But doesn't that make these guesses true? We cannot expect all 10000 Demetris or 8000 Catherines of the island to have similar characters.""Well all the Marias I've ever met have been family oriented and pretty quiet!"" says 25-year-old Nikki Nicolaou. “I know this is a strong generalization but this is just my experience. Likewise I have never met Andrula who was in the artistic profession - I can think of six and they are all mothers and teachers and one works in a bank.”Names can also influence how we choose where to live and what career to pursue.This phenomenon is called “implicit selfishness” which essentially means that our names can determine significant life decisions. This usually applies more to surnames.However research shows that people with unusual names are much more likely to pursue creative careers than the average Joe (or in this case Joseph the 180th most common name in Cyprus).Source: cyprus-mail.com",4
"Traffic cameras issue thousands of fines a day","For what violations do traffic cameras issue fines most often? What kind of control system for non-payers is the police preparing and by what date and what changes have already been approved?From the start of 2024 until this month cameras issued 155350 fines.Violation statisticsThe largest number of violations is for speeding – 99636. Next comes running a red light – 33945 fines. Then - crossing the stop line at a traffic light: 20413 cases.The cameras also recorded 1087 incidents of driving with hands full. In 884 cases drivers were holding a phone in their hands in 203 - a cigarette or other objects.The cameras also do not allow motorcyclists to pass through: 91 people rode without a helmet.The devices registered 178 people who were not wearing a seat belt.Automatic registration of the last three types of violations occurs only if some other violation was first committed and attracted the camera's attention. For example a motorcyclist or car driver was speeding and then the camera noted the absence of a helmet or the use of a phone while driving.Control over non-payment of finesThe Cyprus Police were planning to install the Photorandar list system at airports police stations and checkpoints towards the “TRNC” by this summer. The vehicle recognition system must store data on issued fines in order to prosecute violators who have not paid the fine when crossing the border. However the project is still under evaluation by government agencies and will only be implemented next year.Changes in workPolice regularly check the effectiveness of the cameras. Thus in Nicosia it was decided that two cameras would be placed in places that were considered safe: at the intersection of Makariou and Spiru Kyprianou streets and at the intersection of Strovolou and Mahera streets. They will be installed in other places.During the work of the chambers proposals for amendments were submitted to parliament several times. Of the nine proposals seven were rejected.For example the proposal to forgive student violations to pay fines in installments to toughen penalties for some violations or to provide a discount for prompt payment of a fine was not accepted.Parliament approved the extension of the period for payment of fines from 30 to 60 days and the extension of the period for holding defaulters accountable from 45 days to 90 days.The text was prepared based on materials from SigmaRead alsoIn July police said the automatic fine-issuing system needed to be changed to work properly.

However the Department of the Environment prohibited the work because the line runs through a protected natural area. Additional measures must be taken to continue the project.The text was prepared based on materials from “Philelefteros” On topicRecord demand for electricity was recorded in Cyprus on the evening of July 22.

Shops and offices close island residents head to the mountains.August is vacation time in Cyprus and after August 15 almost all Cypriots go on vacation.Traditionally on August 15 the Day of the Dormition of the Blessed Virgin Mary Cypriots go to the mountains and cook souvlaki.The Forestry Department says there are 44 picnic areas in the mountains with a capacity of 23500 people.

"The level of E. coli on the beach of northern Cyprus is five times higher!","On Tuesday August 13 the TRNC Ministry of Health released the results of water tests on Ayfilon beach near Rizokarpaso - the level of E. coli is off the charts.More than 2400 colony-forming units have been found in 100 milliliters of seawater although their exact number has not been established. 290 intestinal enterococci per 100 ml of water were also recorded. Both of these indicators significantly exceed the maximum permissible levels set by both the Northern Cypriot authorities and the European Union.According to regulations a content of no more than 500 colony-forming units of Escherichia coli and 185 intestinal enterococci per 100 ml of water is considered safe.According to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) even minimal exposure to these bacteria can cause serious illness.

"August 15 – Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary","The Dormition of the Blessed Virgin Mary is one of the most important and most revered holidays in the Orthodox tradition. And in Cyprus and Greece it is also a public holiday.According to the new style the holiday falls on August 15 hence its Greek name “Decapendaugustos”. The holiday is preceded by a period of strict fasting. The Assumption Fast is the shortest in the Orthodox Church it lasts two weeks (from August 1 to August 14).The history of the Feast of the Assumption is rooted in early Christian traditions. The Mother of God Mary having lived a long and pious life died in Jerusalem surrounded by the apostles. Shortly before her death the apostles who were then preaching in different parts of the world were miraculously transported to Jerusalem to say goodbye to the mother of Jesus. Only the Apostle Thomas did not make it to the last meeting.Three days after the death of Mary he also wished to say goodbye to the Mother of God. But when her coffin was opened it turned out that Mary's body had disappeared. That is the Mother of God was ascended into heaven in her body where Jesus crowned her as the Queen of Heaven.The Feast of the Assumption has a deep spiritual meaning. First of all this is the hope of resurrection. The Dormition of Mary and her subsequent ascension to heaven symbolize the transition from earthly life to heavenly life. It reminds believers that death is not considered the end of life but only a transition to eternity with God. Mary's ascension to heaven without bodily decay reminds us that the history of our world will end with the second coming of Jesus Christ and the general resurrection of people in transformed bodies. The first person who received a new transformed body not subject to the laws of the material world was Mary.The Dormition of the Blessed Virgin Mary is not so much a historical event as an important spiritual landmark that reminds believers of eternity and the ultimate goal of Christian life. It teaches humility hope and faith in divine providence strengthening the connection between the earthly and the heavenly.Read alsoCyprus has more holidays and weekends than the rest of the European Union.

"Cyprus's electrical system is strained to the limit","On the evening of Wednesday August 15 rolling blackouts occurred on the island. They were caused by problems at power plants which often occur during the summer season.The transmission system operator reported that at 18:03 a technical fault occurred in one 54-megawatt production unit at the Vasiliko power plant. As a result the station could not fully meet the demand for electricity which caused power outages in different areas of Cyprus.The Cyprus News Agency also reported that at 17:29 problems also occurred in one production unit of the power plant in Dhekelii. However power outages were avoided.After two production units were disabled wind farms saved the day. Evening hours are especially effective for generating electricity from wind energy.However the press representative of the Electricity Transmission System Operator Hara Kushappa emphasized that the electricity supply system is at its maximum capacity. Consumers are therefore urged to use electricity sparingly in the evening especially between 6:00 pm and 10:00 pm which is considered the peak hour for demand.Meanwhile in the territory of the TRNC electric companies in principle cannot cope with the demand for electricity. Kib-Tek and AKSA do not produce enough electricity and rolling blackouts regularly occur in the summer. From June 2023 to June 2024 demand increased by 45%.Electricity company Kib-Tek buys from 10 to 30 megawatts of electricity from the Cyprus Electricity Authority every day at a price of 15 Turkish lira per 1 kilowatt. Producing its own electricity costs the company 9-10 liras per 1 kilowatt and therefore the price for purchasing electricity from the Republic of Cyprus is too high and entails an increase in the Kib-Tek tariff.The text was prepared based on materials from “Sigma” and “Philelephtheros”MeanwhileThe Cyprus Electricity Authority is launching a major project.

"Who were the people who named the two crossroads of Nicosia?","The toponymy of Nicosia still preserves the surnames of its two prominent residents - Gabriel Gavriilidis and Kostas Kalisperas. We tell you why these two people remain in the memory of Cypriots.Locals call the intersection of Nikis Griva Digeni Spirou Kyprianou and Themistokli Dervi avenues “Gavriilidis Crossroads”. And the Kalispera intersection is the entrance to the capital that is the intersection of Athalassas and Lemesou avenues.Gabriel Gavriilidis: entrepreneur and double agentThe future outstanding Cypriot entrepreneur was born in the city of Mersin in Asia Minor (southeast of modern Turkey) in 1910. At the age of 11 he and his family fled Mersin from the Kemalist government which persecuted the national minorities of the former empire.The family settled in Smyrna a city with a huge Greek community. However ethnic cleansing soon began there too. This is how the Gavriilidis ended up in Cyprus. My father a pastry chef by profession managed to quickly get on his feet and launch a successful sweets production business. Thanks to this he was able to send his son to study in the UK.Gabriel Gavriilidis studied at the University of Glasgow and lived in the UK for a total of 10 years. After returning to the island from the UK Gavriilidis got a job at the Nicosia Electricity Company. But then he decided to start his own business. His areas of activity were electronics and electricity import of household appliances.Soon after his return to Cyprus Gavriilidis married Lukia Hadjikyryakou. The story of his matchmaking was anecdotal for that time. One afternoon Gabriel Gavriilidis walked past a private house on the veranda of which he saw a young girl with beautiful legs (as Lukia herself told the story of their acquaintance). The determined young man went straight to her father and said that he intended to marry his daughter. He replied that things are not done that way in Cyprus. And if the young man has serious intentions he and his father should come to their house and woo them. The young man in love compromised and soon Lukia became his wife. In their marriage they had four children.As a dowry her father gave her a piece of land in the area of ​​Agia Omologites. On it in 1962 Gavriilidis built the famous building which gave its name to the intersection of Nikis Griva Digeni Spiru Kyprianou and Themistokli Dervi avenues (Gavriilidis intersection on the map).Gavriilidis was well-known among the British elite of Cyprus whose representatives he often invited home and treated to drinks. The British could not even imagine that their counterparts were actually in close contact with the EOKA partisans and were leaking all the information they received over a glass of whiskey. One of his houses even had a safe house for EOKA members. Gavriilidis was also personally acquainted with President Makarios and supplied him with exotic fruits which he grew on his plot near Paphos.After Cyprus gained independence he was appointed head of the Cyprus Electricity Company. Died in 1975.Kostas Kalisperas: football player developer visionaryThe intersection at the entrance to Nicosia (on the map) still bears the name of Kostas Kalisperas one of the first Cypriot property developers. He was born in 1911 in Nicosia and his whole life was connected with Cyprus.It is to him that the residents of the capital owe the name of one of the districts - Dasupoli. In the 1950s Kalisperas acquired a huge plot of land which was then a landfill and wasteland. There you could easily see a griffon vulture eating a dead cow. The visionary Kalisperas called this dull place “forest city” or “forest city” (as Dasupoli is translated from Greek). In order for his vision to correspond at least a little to reality he and his eldest son went to the wasteland every day cleaned it and planted it with acacias which he bought with his personal money from the Athalassa forestry. Tree seedlings often became victims of goats and sheep but Kostas Kalisperas did not give up. He was an entrepreneur first and foremost and he had big plans for this piece of land.When the former wasteland was finally greened up Kalisperas divided it into several plots and began selling them for 70-80 pounds each. To attract customers he agreed with the Ford dealership so that each of his customers would receive a serious discount on a new car.His son Ramon designed a ten-story residential building in the Dasupoli area. It was for this reason that the intersection at the entrance to Nicosia began to be called the “Kalisperas traffic light” (“ta fota tu Kalispera”).Along with the improvement of the urban environment Kalisperas became seriously interested in football playing as a goalkeeper for the Trust football club. In 1931 he was among the founders of the Olympiacos Nicosia football club and in 1948 of the Orpheas and Omonia clubs.Died in 2005.The text was prepared based on materials from Offsite and “Mihani tu hronu”Read alsoSeveral toponyms in Cyprus are dedicated to the memory of Yuri Gagarin.
